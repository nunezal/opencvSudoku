# opencvSudoku
(Solving Sudoku puzzles from video feed)
This project used Python's OpenCV library for the image processing and used the Tensorflow library to create the deep neural network for digit identification. Once the digits are recognized, the Sudoku solving is done with a slightly modified version of Peter Norvig's code which uses search and constraint propagation to find the missing digits.
